# Automatic-Analysis-of-Descriptive-Answers
• Developed an NLP-driven grading system, seamlessly incorporating plagiarism and grammar checks. Used semantic similarity
checking methods to compare the student answers with solutions.
• Harnessed cutting-edge word embeddings (Word2Vec, Bert, SBert, ELMo) and advanced similarity techniques (Cosine, Word
Movers Distance) to elevate semantic analysis to new heights.
• Deployed machine learning models (Naive Bayes, XLNet) for automated grading, reducing evaluation time by 20%.
• Tested this model on undergraduate students’ answer sheets. Achieved accuracy over 63%
